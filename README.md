## Config

```json
"pathsWarning.styles": {
    "activityBar.background": "#f3002b50",
    "statusBar.background": "#f3002b50",
    "editorGutter.background": "#f3002b50"

## Notes

- to make sure your custom `workbench.colorCustomizations` doesn't get overridden by the extension,<br>
    put your colors under the theme name instead ex.https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_customizing-a-color-theme
